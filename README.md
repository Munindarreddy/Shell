# Shell

This repository is created to add all the basics and learnings related to shell & bash scriptings

Shell is native to linux, you can achive most of the functional requirements straight forward.

1) We will create an instance and on the top of it we will keep all 3 tier in a single, just for the sake of automation.

How to run scripts
# bash scriptName (ensure you're on the path where the script exists)
# ./scriptName (ensure you're on the path where the script exists)


Functional Requirement : Know driving a car Non-Fucntional Requirement : Knowing Rules, when to stop, when to start, which side of the road to go, renew the car tag, emission tag, vin number

Any coding standards should fulfil all of this ( NFR )
Code should always be dry ( That means there should no repeatable code )
Secrets should not hardcoded in the code ( Usernames & Password should never be inside the code )
When you run the same code more than once, it should not fail


Case Standard:

1.STUDENT_NAMES
2.studentNames ( camelCase )
3. StudentNames ( SnakeCase )
