List of actions:
1) Create a git hub account
2) Install Gitbash & VScode on your computer ( if mac, just install git by using "brew install git")
3) Create a repo name shell and this is where we are going to host or upload all our work (Public repo)
4) Open you gitBash, create a folder named b58 (mkdir b58/ )
5) cd b58/ then do a git clone "https url of repo", this is going to create repo
6) On your gitBash, "# code shell/ , this will open the folder on your VSCode


Going forward we are going to do the same for all repositories.
